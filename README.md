# 😶 discup

First things first: I'm sorry 😶

Second things second: Just a dumb script to setup the update of discord to linux.

## install

```
$ wget https://github.com/SadS4ndWiCh/discup/releases/latest/download/discup && chmod +x discup && sudo mv discup /usr/local/bin
```

## how to use

```
discup [DIRECTORY]

DIRECTORY - The destination directory. Default to `/opt/Discord` if empty.
```

Just type the following command and ok. Simple as that.

```sh
$ discup
```

If you want, you can install it in a custom directory by giving the desired location.

```sh
$ discup ~/Programs/Discord
```

## how it works

TL;DR
First it install the discord in `.tar.gz` compressed format, extract it and move the files to some specific directories.

But the steps are:

1. Removes all files from old version.
2. Download the new Discord version from `https://discord.com/api/download?platform=linux&format=tar.gz`.
3. Extract the compressed file.
4. Removes compressed file.
5. Move the folder to desired directory.
6. Create a copy of Discord's desktop configuration to `/usr/share/applications`.
7. Create a link of Discord's binary to `/usr/local/bin`.
